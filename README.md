# acuity-to-ical

This simple script runs on a node server, and parses an Acuity feed into an iCal feed.

I use it for my personal trainer - I book my appointments with him on his Acuity booking page, then using this script, they appear on my calendar.

## How to Use

1. You have to run this using node on your own server.

2. Set up the .env file as directed

3. When you visit the URL, you will receive an ICS (iCal) file in return. So just add the URL as a subscription in your favorite calendar app.
